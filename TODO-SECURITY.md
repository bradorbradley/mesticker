# Security TODO

## Environment File History
**IMPORTANT**: .env files may exist in git history. 

Found commit: `c754d21 Add environment variable control for testing mode`

### Action Required:
1. Audit commit `c754d21` to check if API keys were committed
2. If keys were exposed, rotate all API keys immediately  
3. Consider using `git-filter-branch` or `BFG Repo-Cleaner` to scrub history
4. Update all deployment environments with new keys

### Current Status:
- ✅ Added .env files to .gitignore
- ✅ Using .env.local for local development only
- ⚠️ Git history needs audit for exposed secrets
